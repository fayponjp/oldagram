This is a project from the Front End Developer course at Scrimba.

The goal is to recreate Instagram's UI, as shown in this Figma draft - [Link Here, please make a draft if you're interested!](https://www.figma.com/design/h0MKma9TTWzGOMQ9Ia6ROW/Oldagram?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=CY0QJwafbNp15wcj-0)

Goals for this project:
- Given only the images, the html containing the logo, and a javascript file containing the post data, create the UI as shown on Figma
- Start with 1 post, style the user and their post image with hardcoded data copied from the first record in the JS file
- Stretch Goal 1: dynamically create posts from the array in the provided JS
- Stretch Goal 2: Increase the amount of Likes when interacting with either the post or the heart icon
